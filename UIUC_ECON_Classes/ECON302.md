## Lesson 1
### Lesson 1.02 Positive versus Normative

#### Economics
The social science that studies the choices individuals make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influences their choices  

#### Scarce 
A good is scarce if you have to give something up to get it

#### Positive vs Normative
##### Positive Analysis
- Statement about how the world is 
- Analysis describing relationships of cause and effect
- Able to be proven true or false with observable data
##### Normative Analysis
- A value judgement about costs and benefits which describes what situation an individual refers 
- Inherently subjective
#### Hypothesis
An assertion of relationship between two or more variables that could be proven true or false

#### Regression Analysis
A method of statistical analysis which uses data to determine the effect of one or more variables on another 

### Lesson 1.3 Elements of Theory
#### Big Data
Companies and governments can collect large amounts of data on individual behavior. Statistical analysis of this data can reveal trends and correlations between variables

#### Important Tips
1. Correlation does not equal to causation
2. A.I algorithm cannot determine the causation, only correlation
3. The more variables that we look at, the more likely we are to find two variables that are randomly correlated
4. we must have a theory about why we observe the things we do

#### Theory
A simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other
The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials

#### Elements of Theory
**Simple** -- Focusing on fewer variables than the real world
**General** -- Applies everywhere and always
**Useful** -- Able to correctly predict real world phenomenon

## Lesson 2
### Lesson 2.01 Single-Variable Demand
#### Law of Demand
There is an inverse relationship between the price of good and quantity demand of that good

#### Demand Curve
A line of curve shows the quantity demand of a good over a range of possible prices

#### Demand Function
Mathematical relationship where quantity demanded is a function of price 
> 𝑄d=𝑓(𝑃)

#### Inverse demand function
change the position of price and quantity
for example:
> Q = 150 - 50P
> Q + 50P = 150
> P = 3 - 0.02Q -- inverse demand function

The demand line is a graph of the inverse demand function

#### choke price
the price when the quantity demand is 0

#### Reservation price
- The highest price a person is willing to pay and still purchasing the good
- In theory, the maximum a person would be willing to pay would be equal to their use value
- The inverse demand function has price on the lefthand side. This price can also be considered the reservation price for a particular unit of the good

Demand curves slop downward showing the inverse relationship between price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good

The demand curve can tell you the quantity demanded at a given price or the height can tell you the reservation price of a given unit of the good


### Lesson 2.02 Multivariable Demand

#### Multivariable Demand Function:
Mathematical relationship between quantity demanded and the several variables that can affect it
```
Qdx = f(px, py, I, H)
quantity demanded of Good x is a function of the price of GoodX (PX), the price of Good Y(PY), Income, and a host of other important factors(H)
```

#### Change in Demand
A rightward or leftward shift of the entire demand curve for a good that is caused by a change in something other than the price of that good
For example, an increase in the number of exams shifted the entire demand curve for coffee to the right
#### Law of Demand(Version2)
An increase in the price of Good X will cause the quantity demanded of Good x to fall and a decrease in the price of Good X will cause the quantity demanded of Good X to rise, ceteris paribus
`Ceteris Paribus` - holding all else constant

Expansion in Demand -- shift rightward, demand a higher quantity at any given price
Contraction in Demand -- shift leftward, demand a lower quantity at any given price
Change in Quantity Demanded -- A movement along a stationary demand curve of a good due to a change in the price of that good

#### Common Causes of Demand Shifts
##### Ceteris Paribus Conditions
1. Consumer's income
2. Prices of related goods
3. Tastes/quality
4. Consumer expectations
5. Number of buys

##### Normal Good
- When consumers get **richer**, demand for a normal good **expands**
- When consumers get **poorer**, demand for a normal good **contracts**

##### Inferior Good
- When consumers get **richer**, demand for an inferior good **contracts**
- When consumers get **poorer**, demand for an inferior good **expands**

##### Complements
- When the price of Good A **rises** the demand for Good B **contracts**
- When the price of Good A **falls** the demand for Good B **expands**

##### Substitutes
- When the price of Good X **rises** demand for Good Y **expands**
- When the price of Good X **falls** demand for Good Y **contracts**

##### Consumer Expectations
- If new information is revealed and consumers believe the future price will be **higher** than they previously thought, the demand today will **expand**
- If new information is revealed and consumers believe the future price will be **lower** than they previously thought, the demand today will **contract**

##### Number of Consumers
- At any given price, if the size of the population of consumers **grows**, then the demand will **expand** 
- At any given price, if the size of the population of consumers **falls**, then the demand will **contract** 

##### Everything Else
- If willingness to pay **rises**, then demand **expands**
- If willingness to pay **falls**, then demand **contracts**

#### Changes in Demand
##### Expansion
- Increase in income for a normal good 
- Decrease in income for an inferior good
- Increase in the price of a substitute
- Decrease in the price of a complement
- Expecting the price to rise in the future
- Increase in the number of consumers

##### Contraction
- Decrease in income for a normal good
- Increase in income for an inferior good
- Decrease in the price of a substitute
- Increase in the price of a complement
- Expecting the price to fall in the future
- Decrease in the number of consumers

### Lesson 2.03 Single-Variable Supply
#### Law of Supply
There is a positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied of that good

#### Supply Function
Mathematical relationship where quantity supplied is a function of price

#### Supply Curve
A line or curve that shows the quantity supplied of a good over a range of possible prices

#### Marginal Cost
The change in total cost that producers incur when they produce an additional unit
"marginal" means "change in"

#### Law of Escalating Marginal Cost
Also called the last of increasing marginal cost

The proposition that as quantity produced increases the marginal cost also increases

For example, if the first unit will add 1 dollar, the second will add more about 1 dollar

#### Profit Maximization Rule 
Competitive firms will compare the price they can sell at to their marginal cost

Any time the extra cost of producing another unit is less than the price, then producing that unit will increase their profit

#### Summary
- Supply curves slop upward showing the escalating marginal costs of production
- The supply curve can tell you the quantity supplied at a given price or the height can tell you the marginal cost of given unit of the good
- Remember: the height of the supply curve already tells you the change in total cost, you will NOT need to find the change in the height to find marginal cost
### Lesson 2.04 Multivariable Supply
#### Multivariable Supply Function
Mathematical relationship between quantity supplied and the several variables that can affect it

#### Change in Supply
A rightward or leftward shift of the supply curve for a good that is caused by a change in something other than the price that the good sells at

#### Law of Supply (version2)
An increase in the price of Good X will cause the quantity supplied of Good X to rise and a decrease in the price of Good X will cause the quantity supplied of Good X to fall, ceteris paribus

#### Common causes of supply shifts
##### Ceteris Paribus Conditions
1. input prices
2. production technology 
3. producer expectations
4.  number of sellers

##### Input Prices
- Input price refers to a price of a good that is used to produce another good
- Input prices **rise** which causes supply to **contract** 
- Input prices **fall** which causes supply to **expand**

##### Production Technology
- When production technology **improves** supply **expands**
- When production technology **worsens** or is **restricted**, then supply **contracts**

##### Producer Expectations
- If new information is revealed and producers believe the future price will be **higher** than they previously through, the supply today will **contract** as they wait to sell at the higher price
- If new information is revealed and producers believe the future price will be **lower** than they previously through, the supply today will **expand** as they wait to sell at the higher price

##### Number of Suppliers
If additional suppliers **enter** the market, then supply will **expand**
If suppliers **exit** the market, then supply will **contract**

##### Everything Else
If Marginal Cost **falls**, this causes Supply to **expand**
If Marginal Cost **rises**, this causes Supply to **contract**

#### Changes in Supply
##### Expansion
- Decrease in input price
- Improvement in production technology
- Reduction of Marginal Costs
- Decrease in Expected Future Price
- Increase in the Number of Firms

##### Contraction
- Increase in input price
- Worsening production technology
- Increase of Marginal Costs
- Increase in Expected Future Price
- Decrease in the Number of Firms
#### Summary
- There are many things that can affect quantity supplied and the multivariable supply function keeps track of all of them.
- The single-variable supply function for Good X freezes all variables other than the price of Good X and just looks at the effect of a change in the price of Good X on the quantity supplied of Good X.

### Lesson 2.05 Equilibrium
#### Surplus
At the current price, the quantity supplied is **greater** than the quantity demanded
Surpluses will tend to drive prices **down**

#### Shortage
At the current price, the quantity supplied is **less** than the quantity demanded
Shortages will tend to drive prices **up**

#### Market-Clearing Price
The price at which quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied

#### Equilibrium
There is no upward pressure or downward pressure on price

#### Summary
- Price is the outcome of adjustments caused by shortages and surpluses.
- The market will “gravitate” to a combination of price and quantity where the market clears. 
- If there is a change to demand or supply, the market will gravitate to a new combination of price and quantity.

### Lesson 2.06 Comparative Statics
#### Comparative Statics
A process where we compare the price and quantity at an initial equilibrium to the price and quantity of a new equilibrium after demand or supply has changed

#### Comparative Statics Steps
1. Start in equilibrium
2. Change a determining factor
3. Determine the impact on Demand or Supply
4. Finish up in a new equilibrium

#### FLOPs
A floating-point operation(FLOP) is a type of computer operation. One FLOP is equivalent to one addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two decimal numbers

#### Price Gouging
A pejorative term for when suppliers raise price above what is deemed "fair"

#### Summary
- Consider the effect of an outside factor on the market you are analyzing. The outside factor may cause a change in demand or a change in supply or both.
- If both demand and supply change, then the change in price or the change in quantity will be uncertain.
- Laws that prevent prices from rising will tend to have unintended consequences of prolonging shortages. 

## Lesson 3
### Lesson 3.01 Own-Price Elasticity
#### Law of Demand version 2
An increase in the price of Good X will cause the quantity demanded of Good X to fall and a decrease in the price of Good X will cause the quantity demanded of Good X to rise, ceteris paribus.

The law of demand tells us the direction of the quantity response but does not tell us how big that response is.

#### change in percentage
%∆𝑋=(𝑋_𝑁𝑒𝑤−𝑋_𝑂𝑙𝑑 )/𝑋_𝑂𝑙𝑑
∆ means change

#### Elasticity
A measure of responsiveness of one variable to a change in one of its determinants 

#### Own-Price Elasticity of Demand
A measure of responsiveness of quantity demand of good x to change in the price of good x
##### formula
$𝐸_𝐷$=(%∆𝑄_𝐷𝑋)/(%∆𝑃_𝑋 )

Using Calculus Formula 
$𝐸_𝐷$=($𝜕𝑄_𝐷𝑋$)/($𝜕𝑃_𝑋$ )∗$𝑃_𝑋$/$𝑄_𝐷𝑋$ 

### Law of Supply
An increase in the price of Good X will cause the quantity supplied of Good X to rise and a decrease in the price of Good X will cause the quantity supplied of Good X to fall, ceteris paribus

The law of supply tells us the direction of the quantity response but does not tell us how big that response is

### Own-Price Elasticity Supply 
##### Percentage change formula
$𝐸_𝑆$=(%$∆𝑄_𝑆𝑋$)/(%∆𝑃_𝑋 )

##### formula for calculus
$𝐸_𝑆$=($𝜕𝑄_𝑆𝑋$)/(𝜕𝑃_𝑋 )∗$𝑃_𝑋$/𝑄_𝑆𝑋 

#### Summary
- The own-price elasticity is a score that measures size of the effect of a price change of Good X on the quantity of Good X
- A negative sign of own-price elasticity tells you price and quantity move in opposite directions (demand). A positive sign tells you they move in the same direction (supply)
- After taking the absolute value, a bigger number indicates a bigger effect

### Lesson 3.02 Categories of Elasticity
`Own-Price Elasticity of Demand`- A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded of good X to a change in the price of good X.

`Own-Price Elasticity of Supply`- A measure of responsiveness of quantity supplied of good X to a change in the price of good X.

#### categories of elasticity
1. Perfectly inelastic: E = 0 
	Change in price has no effect on quantity demanded (or supplied)
2. Inelastic: 0 < |E| < 1
	A percentage change in price has caused a smaller percentage change in quantity
3. Unit elastic: |E| = 1
	A percentage change in price has caused an equal percentage change in quantity
4. Elastic: 1 < |E| < ∞
	A percentage change in price has caused a larger percentage change in quantity
5. Perfectly Elastic: |E| = ∞
	A percentage change in price has caused an infinite percentage change in quantity

#### Characteristics of Elastic Goods
1. Availability of Substitutes
2. Large Share of Budget
3. Time Horizon for Adjustment

#### Summary
- After taking the absolute value of an elasticity, it will fit into one of five categories that represent how responsive a good is to a change in its price. 
- Demanders (or suppliers) will have different elasticities depending on the good and the current price of the good.
- Flatter curves will tend to be more elastic. Steeper curves will tend to be more inelastic.
- More flexibility tends to mean the good will be more elastic

### Lesson 3.03 Elasticity, Expenditure and Revenue
#### Expenditure and Revenue 
`Expenditure`- The total amount spent by consumers. 
Expenditure = Price * Quantity

`Revenue`- The total amount received by producers. It must be equal to expenditures.
Revenue = Price * Quantity


In the `elastic region` of a demand curve:
A price **increase** will cause expenditure and revenue to **decrease**.
A price **decrease** will cause expenditure and revenue to **increase**.

In the `inelastic region` of a demand curve:
A price **increase** will cause expenditure and revenue to **increase**.
A price **decrease** will cause expenditure and revenue to **decrease**.

If demand curve is `unit elastic`:
Expenditure and revenue will **stay** the same if price **changes**.
![[Screenshot 2025-09-13 at 08.02.53.png]]

#### Summary 
- Expenditure is equal to revenue. Both are Price multiplied by Quantity.
- Whether a price increase causes expenditures or revenues to increase or decrease depends on the elasticity


### Lesson 3.03 Other Elasticities
#### Own-Price Elasticity of Demand and Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
**Own-Price Elasticity of Demand**- A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded of good X to a change in the price of **good X**
**Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand**- A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded of good X to a change in the price of **good Y**

#### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand -- Formula
𝐸_𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠=(%∆𝑄_𝐷𝑋)/(%∆𝑃_𝑌 )

Calculus Formula
𝐸_𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠=(𝜕𝑄_𝐷𝑋)/(𝜕𝑃_𝑌 )∗𝑃_𝑌/𝑄_𝐷𝑋 

#### Income Elasticity of Demand
A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded of good X to a change in income
##### Formula
𝐸_𝐼𝑛𝑐=(%∆𝑄_𝐷𝑋)/(%∆𝐼)

##### Calculus Formula
𝐸_𝐼𝑛𝑐=$\frac{(𝜕𝑄_{𝐷𝑋})}{𝜕𝐼}$∗$\frac{𝐼}{𝑄_𝐷𝑋}$

#### Summary
- The concept of elasticity can be modified to measure the size of the effect of changes in other factors such as the prices of other goods and income
- For these other elasticities, the sign can be either positive or negative and will tell you key information about the direction of the effect


## Lesson 4

### Lesson 4.01 Consumer Preferences 

#### Modeling Preferences - predict what consumers will do
- Market Bundle (or Basket) -- List with specific quantities of one or more goods 
- We assume people choose between options in the way that will make them happiest (maximize their utility). 
- If a person chooses one bundle over another, they must prefer it. This process is called “revealed preferences.”
#### Completeness
Consumers can compare and rank all possible bundles

#### Indifference
When a consumer is equally happy with either of two bundles
This does not mean that a people do not want the good. They just like the two goods equally

#### Transitivity
If A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C,  then A will be preferred to C.
A > B > C

##### Intransitive Preference
A>B>C>A
These preferences form a loop

#### More is Better
If Bundle X has at least as much of every good as Bundle Y, plus more of one good, then Bundle X is preferred to Bundle Y.
This does not mean that a person just chooses the bundle with the most total objects

![[Screenshot 2025-09-13 at 14.23.18.png]]

#### Marginal Rate of Substitution
MRS is the rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute one good for another and still maintain the same level of satisfaction

Marginal -The change in some variable
##### Formula
MRS =  $MU_X$ / $MU_Y$

#### Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution
As the consumer obtains more of Good X, the amount of Good Y she is willing to give up for another unit of Good X decreases.

“The more of a good I have the less I’m willing to give up to get another unit.”

#### Utility and Utility Function
`Utility` -- A numerical score representing the satisfaction that a consumer gets from a given market bundle

`Utility Function` - A formula that assigns a utility score to a bundle of goods
U = f(x, y)

#### Indifference Curve
Also called an Isoutility curve
Shows all possible combinations of two goods that generate the same level of utility

![[Screenshot 2025-09-13 at 14.30.45.png]]


#### Indifference Curves and Elevation Maps
We have three variables(U,X, and Y) but only two dimensions
An indifference curve is like a line on an elevation map. All points on the same line have the same height above sea-level

#### Cobb-Douglas Utility Function
General Function Form:
U = a$X^c$ $Y^d$ 
For example:
U = $X^{0.25}$ $Y^{0.5}$
In this case, the individual likes Good Y **2 times more** than Good X on average

#### Marginal Utility
The change in an individual's total utility from receiving an additional unit of good

In Mathematics Way:
$𝑀𝑈_𝑋$=$𝜕𝑈/𝜕𝑋$

#### Diminishing Marginal Utility
The increase in utility attained from receiving another unit of Good X, gets smaller at higher levels of Good X

#### Marginal Rate of Substitution (Calculus Formula)
$MRS_{XY}$ = ${MU_X}$ / ${MU_Y}$
比如说
$MRS_{XY}$ = $x^{0.25}$ $Y^{0.5}$
那么，当我们有10个Y，10个X的时候，
0.5Y/X= 0.5 10/10 = 0.5, 也就是说我们会愿意用一般的Y去换一个苹果
当我们有40个Y 和10个X的时候
0.5Y/X = 0.5 40/10 = 2，也就是说我们会用2个Y去换一个X
当我们有10个Y和40个X的时候
0.5Y/X = 0.5 10/40 = 0.125
也就是说我们会用0.15个Y去换一个X

#### Cobb-Douglas Shortcut for MRS
All Cobb-Douglas Utility functions create a similar result for the $MRS_{XY}$ calculation

𝑈=𝑎$𝑋^𝑐$ $𝑌^𝑑$

$𝑀𝑅S_{𝑋𝑌}$=𝑐/𝑑  𝑌/𝑋

#### Perfect Substitutes
Two goods for which the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other is constant
There is **no diminishing** to the marginal rate of substitution
当两种商品是完美替代品时，消费者会根据它们的相对价格来决定购买的数量
当题干中出现 U = X$P_X$ + Y$P_Y$ 的时候，两个goods就是perfect substitute

#### Perfect Complements
Getting more of one good will not increase utility unless it comes with an increase in the other good as well
Two goods for which the marginal rate of substitution is either infinite or zero

#### Summary
- There are four main assumptions economists make about what consumer preferences have in common
- We use a utility function to model a particular consumer's preferences
- The absolute value of the slope of an indifference curve tells us the consumer's marginal rate of substitution
- Different shapes for the indifference curve allow us to model different types of preference


### Lesson 4.02 Budget Constraints
#### Budget Constraint
The boundaries in consumption that individuals face as a result of limited incomes
##### Budget Line Formula
M =$P_X$X + $P_Y$Y

#### Market Rate of Substitution
MktRS is the rate at which one good can be traded for another; the absolute value of the slope of the budget line
##### Formula
$MktRS_{XY}$ = $P_X$ / $P_Y$

#### Summary
- The budget line is a visual representation of the possible combinations of two goods that a consumer is able to purchase when spending their entire budget
- The market rate of substitution(MktRS) is how much of Good Y the consumer gives up to buy one unit of Good X and is the absolute value of the slope of the budget line
- Holding all elese constant, reductions in the price of Good X will shift the X-intercept to the right while the Y-intercept stays the same
- Holding all else constant, reductions in the consumer's income will shift both the X and Y intercepts towards the origin but the slope of the budget line will stay the same

### Lesson 4.03 Utility Maximization
#### Optimizing Condition
Utility is highest where:
1. Slope of the indifference curve = slope of the budget line
2. Marginal Rate of Substitution = Market Rate of Substitution
3. $MU_X$ / $MU_Y$ = $P_X$ / $P_Y$

#### Summary 
- We assume the consumer's goal is to maximize utility subject to their budget constraint. In other words, choose the bundle on their budget line that has the highest utility
- If possible, the combination of Good X and Good Y on a budget constraint that maximizes utility will be the point where $MRS_{XY}$ = $MktRS_{XY}$

### Lesson 4.04 Utility Maximization Examples
#### Corner Solution
A situation in which the marginal rate of substitution of one good for another cannot be equal for non-negative quantities of both goods
The consumer will choose to spend their entire budget on only Good X or only Good Y whichever brings the highest utility

$MRS_{XY}$ -- How much of Good Y the consumer is willing to give up to get a unit of Good X
$MktRS_{XY}$ -- How much of Good Y the consumer has to give up to get a unit of Good X

#### Summary 
- Usually, we can use the optimization rule: $MRS_{XY}$ = $MktRS_{XY}$ to solve for the utility-maximizing bundle of Good X and Y
- If not, we have other strategies:
	1. More Good X if $MRS_{XY}$ > $MktRS_{XY}$
	2. Less Good X if $MRS_{XY}$ < $MktRS_{XY}$


## Lesson 5
### Lesson 5.1 Income and Substitution Effects
#### Why does consumers buy less goods when the price rises
Increasing in price means that buying a unit of one good needs to giving up more units of other good
	As a result, one good become relatively more expensive and another one become relatively less expensive
	And a consumer will substitute away from the expensive good and toward cheaper good

#### Substitution Effect
The change in the amount of Good X consumed associated with a change in the price of Good X, with utility held constant

Since one of our goods became more expensive, the dollars the consumer has will purchase less. It is like they became **poorer**
A consumer will change buying behavior when their **income** changes

#### Income Effect
The change in the amount of Good X consumed associated with a change in consumer's purchasing power, with relative prices held constant

> The price change create both an Income Effect and a Substitution Effect simultaneously

#### Compensated Budget Line
1. Uses the new relative prices
2. A new level of income to compensate for any changes to purchasing power and 
3. Is tangent to the original indifference curve
#### How to Find the Compensated Budget Line
1. FInd $MRS_{XY}$
	1. $MU_X$
	2. $MU_Y$
	3. $MRS_{XY} = \frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}$
2. Calculate $MktRS_{XY} = \frac{P_X}{P_Y}$
3. Set $MRS_{XY} = MktRS_{XY}$ and then solve the optimization condition for Y
4. Calculate utility from original bundle
5. Substitute the level of utility from Step 4 and Y from Step 3 into the utility function then solve for X
6. Use X with the optimization condition from Step 3 to find Y
Suppose X is the good that raised the price
Total Effect: New X - Original X
Substitution Effect: Compensated X - Original X
Income Effect: New X - Compensated X

#### Summary
- The sum of the income and substitution effects is the total effect of a price change
- A compensated budget line compensated for changes to purchasing power. It eliminates the income effect and leaves only the substitution effect
- If $P_X$ rises, then the compensation will be to increase income. If $P_X$ falls, then the compensation will be to reduce income

### Lesson 5.2: Examples of Income and Substitution Effects
#### Quantity-Dependent Pricing
The price paid by the consumer will be affected by the quantity of units the consumer purchases 

#### Summary
- Any policy from a business or government can create price or income changes
- Breaking down income and substitution effects can help us determine the results of policies

### Lesson 5.3 Giffen Goods

#### Giffen Good
- A good where price decreases lead to decreases in the consumption of that good and price increases increases of that good
- The income effect and substitution effects are in opposite directions and the absolute value of the income effect is greater than the absolute value of the substitution effect
- These goods can only be inferior. However, not all inferior goods are Giffen Goods
![[Screenshot 2025-10-11 at 13.45.32.png]]
#### Summary
- Given the assumptions on preferences, it is not guaranteed that a price decrease causes a quantity demanded to increase for an individual
- For normal goods, price decreases will definitely cause quantity demanded to rise
- For inferior goods, it could be possible that a price decrease would cause quantity demanded to fall. his is the Giffen Good

## Lesson 6
### Lesson 6.01 Individual Demand Curves
#### Individual Demand Curve
A curve that relates the price of the Good X to the quantity of Good X that a consumer will buy holding all other factors constant

#### How to find an Individual Demand Function
1. FInd $MRS_XY$
	1. $MU_X$
	2. $MU_Y$
	3. $MRS_{XY} = \frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}$
2. $MktRS_{XY}$ = $\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$ Leaving PX as a variable
3. Use optimizing condition: $MRS_{XY} = MktRS_{XY}$
	1. Solve Optimizing Condition for Y
4. Solve for Optimal Quantities
	1. Substitute Y from 3A into the budget constraint 
	2. Solve for X
#### Demand Function Notation
lowercase 'q' refers to an individual's quantity demanded 
Uppercase 'Q' refers to the market quantity demanded
#### Interpreting Individual Demand Curve
- As price falls, consumers can attain higher level of utility
- Each point of the individual demand curve represents a utility-maximizing choice by a consumer

#### Summary
- Leaving M, $P_X$ and $P_Y$ as variables while completing the utility--maximization process yield a demand function for a good
- Doing a comparative statics analysis of the variables M, and $P_y$ shows whether a good is normal/inferior and substitutes/complements respectively

### Lesson 6.02 Horizontal Summation of Demand
#### Horizontal Summation
A process which adds the quantities demanded by individuals (q) for a given price to get the market quantity (Q) for that price

#### Identical Demand Function
$Q_D$ = n* $q_{Di}$

#### Summary 
- Market demand functions are the horizontal sum of the individual demand functions
- The number of kinks is one less than the number of unique choke prices

### Lesson 0.603 Consumer Surplus
#### Consumer Surplus
The price that a consumer is willing to pay for a good minus what the consumer actually pays for it

#### Summary 
- The area between the demand curve and the price and bounded on the right by then quantity is the consumer surplus
- The change in consumer surplus will be the area between the two prices bounded on the right by the demand curve

## Lesson7
### Lesson 07.01 Production Functions
#### Factors of Production (Inputs)
1. **Labors** -- the number of workers or the number of hours worked by people. Variable: **L**
2. **Capital** -- also called physical capital. Machines, equipment, buildings and tools used in the production process. Variable: **K**
3. **Human Capital** -- Knowledge and experience of workers
4. Other inputs: Materials, Land

#### Production Function
A function showing the highest output that a firm can produce for every specified combination of inputs
Functional Form: q = f(L, K)
Lowercase 'q' represents output of an individual firm
"Output(q) depends on the amount of labor and capital used"
#### Law of Marginally Diminishing Returns
Principle that as the use of an input increase, with other inputs fixed, the resulting additions to output will eventually decrease. Also called **Diminishing Marginal Returns**

#### Cobb-Douglas Production Function
General Functional Form:
q = $aL^cK^d$
Values can be used for parameters a, c and d to fit a particular the production technology and productivity of a specific industry

#### Short Run and Long Run
**Short Run** -- Period of time where one input is considered to be fixed
Technically, capital(size of the factory) are considered as fixed , since it is easier to change the size of labor
**Long Run** -- Period of time where all inputs can be changed

#### Marginal Product of Labor ($MP_L$)
The change in output that is the result of increasing the amount of labor used by 1 unit

##### Marginal Product of Labor($MP_L$) Function
The change in output for a change in labor while holding other inputs constant. The partial derivative of the production function with respect to Labor
$$MP_L = \frac{\partial q}{\partial L}$$
#### Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) Function
The change in output for a change in capital while holding other inputs constant
The partial derivative of the production function with respect to Capital
$$MP_K = \frac{\partial q}{\partial K}$$
#### Average Product of Labor Function($AP_L$)
Total product divided by the amount of labor
$$AP_L = \frac{q}{L}$$
Both $MP_L$ and $AP_L$ diminish as labor is increased. However, $AP_L$ is always greater than $MP_L$ for any given level of labor

#### Summary
- Total product of labor curves(holding capital constant) will increase at a decreasing rate because of marginally diminishing returns to labor
- Marginal Product of Labor(and Capital) curves represent the slope of their total product curves and will slop downward
- Increasing Capital increases both total product of labor and marginal product of labor

### Lesson 07.02: Returns to Scale
#### Law of Marginally Diminishing Returns
Principle that as the use of an input increases, with other inputs fixed, the resulting additions to output will eventually decrease

#### Returns to Scale
The change in total output when changing both labor and capital in equal proportions
- **Constant Returns to Scale**: Output changes by the same proportion that labor and. capital is changed. For instance, doubling both labor and capital doubles output
- **Increasing Returns to Scale**: Output changes more than the proportion that labor and capital is changed. For instance, doubling both labor and capital more than doubles output
- **Decreasing Returns to Scale**: Output changes less than the proportion that labor and capital is changed. For instance, doubling both labor and capital less than doubles output
#### Cobb-Douglas Parameters and Returns to Scale
Cobb-Douglas General Function Form: 
$$ q = aL^cK^d$$
**Constant Returns to Scale:** c+d = 1
**Increasing Returns to Scale:** c+d > 1
**Decreasing Returns to Scale:** c+d < 1

#### Summary
- Generally, you can test for returns to scale by trying a given level of labor and capital and then doubling them
- As companies get bigger, they may be able to have workers specialize which increases productivity. This would mean increasing returns to scale 
- Companies that get bigger may find management harder. This would lead to decreasing returns to scale

### Lesson 07.03 Isoquants
#### Isoquant
A curve showing all the possible combinations of inputs that yield a given amount of output

#### Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)
The amount by which one input can be reduced when one extra unit of another input is used
$$MRTS_{LK} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$$
$MRTS_{LK}$ -- How much capital can I give up when I hire one more unit of labor and still maintain the same level of output
$MP_L$ -- How productive is another of labor
$MP_K$-- How productive was the capital
For example, if $MRTS_{LK}$ = 5, we can say that we can replace 5 units of capital by 1 unit of labor

#### Cobb-Douglas Shortcut for $MRTS_{LK}$
All Cobb-Douglas Utility functions create a similar result for the $MRTS_{LK}$ calculation
$q = aL^cK^d$
$MRTS_{LK} = \frac{c}{d} \times \frac{K}{L}$

#### Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution ($MRTS_{KL}$)
The amount by which one input can be reduced when one extra unit of another input is used
$$MRTS_{KL} = \frac{MP_K}{MP_L}$$
$MRTS_{LK}$ -- How much labor can I give up when I hire one more unit of capital and still maintain the same level of output
$MP_L$ -- How productive is another of labor
$MP_K$-- How productive was the capital

#### Fixed-Proportions Production Function
- A production function with L-shaped isoquants. MRTS is either infinite or zero
- Input are combined in specific combinations and the ratio of one input to another does not change
- Also known as Leontief Production Function

#### Perfect Substitutes Production Function
- A production function where the MRTS is constant at all points
- Isoquants are linear
- The term, "perfect substitutes," does not mean you can exchange inputs 1-for-1. The important thing is that you can make some substitution over and over without changing the ratio

#### Summary
- Isoquants visualize all the possible input combinations that yield a given level of output
- The absolute value of the slope of an isoquant tells you the amount of the input on the Y-axis you can give up when you add one more unit of the input on the X-axis

## Lesson 8
### Lesson 08.01 Economic and Accounting Costs
#### Explicit versus Implicit Cost
**Explicit Costs:** Observable expenses for a firm or person. These costs involve giving a sum of money to another party

**Implicit Costs:** The value given up from decisions regarding the use of resources. These costs may or may not be denominated in dollars. They do not involve directly paying another party

#### Accounting Cost versus Economic Cost
**Accounting Costs** The total of all explicit costs
**Economic Costs** The total of all explicit and implicit cost

#### Accounting Profit versus Economic Profit
**Accounting Profit:** Accounting revenue minus accounting cost
**Economic Profit:** Total revenue minus accounting cost and any implicit cost

#### Sunk Cost
A past cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered
Once a cost is sunk, only future costs are relevant to a decision

#### Sunk Cost Fallacy
When someone makes a decision based on past fixed costs rather than on future costs and benefits

#### Summary
- Economic profit considers the profit of forgone opportunities as an implicit cost
- The more time, money and effort you sink into a project, the harder it is to walk away
- Having many small projects that you can experiment with, may make your life easier and more profitable

### Lesson 08.02 Average and Marginal Costs
#### $MP_L$ and Diminishing Productivity
**Marginal Product of Labor:** The increase in output associated with increasing labor by one unit
**Diminishing Marginal Productivity:** Each additional unit of an input, holding other inputs constant, adds a smaller and smaller amount to total output

#### Types of Costs
**Fixed Cost:** A cost that is the same regardless of output
**Variable Cost:** A cost that changes as output changes
**Total Cost:** The sum of all the costs for a given level of output

**Average Total Cost(ATC):** The total cost divided by the output 
$$ATC = \frac{TC}{q}$$
**Marginal Cost:** The amount that an additional unit adds to total cost
$$ MC = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial q}$$
#### Escalating Marginal Costs
As more of a good is produced, the **cost** of an **additional** unit of the good **increases**
Also called "increasing marginal cost"

#### Summary
- Marginal cost is the change in total cost
- Average total cost is the total cost divided by output
- Since MC is about the change in costs, it will ignore any fixed costs in the short run
- ATC and MC intersect at the minimum of ATC

### Lesson 08.03 Short Run Cost
#### Input Prices
**Wage(W):** Price for hiring labor
**Rental Rate(r):** Price for renting a unit of capital

> Rental Rate is always a part of cost 

#### Total Cost as a function of labor and Capital
$$ \text{Total Cost} = wL + rK $$
wL = the total amount spent on labor
rK = the total amount spent on capital

#### Important Features of Total Cost
- The Slope of the Total Cost function represents the change in costs(Marginal Costs)
- The slope of the total Cost function is positive and increasing (total costs increase at an increasing rate)
- When total costs increase at an increasing rate, marginal cost are upward sloped

#### Marginal Cost
The change in total cost as a result of a change in output
$$ MC = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial q} $$
#### Summary
- Total costs increase at an increasing rate
- This means that marginal cost will be higher values at higher quantities of output
- Average Total Cost(ATC) will typically be U-shaped
- Marginal Cost and ATC will intersect at the minimum of ATC
- Marginal Cost and Average Variable Cost(AVC) will intersect a the minimum AVC

### Lesson 08.04 Cost Minimization
#### Isocost Line
All the different combinations of Capital and Labor that end up costing the same amount in total

#### Market Rate of Input Substitution
(MktRIS) The relative cost of the inputs. Also, this is the absolute value of the slope of the isocost line
$$ MktRIS_{LK} = \frac{w}{r} $$
The relative cost of labor relative to capital

#### Optimizing Condition
Total Cost is lowest where:
Slope of the isoquant curve = Slope of isocost curve
Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution = Market Rate of Input Substitution
$$ \frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \frac{w}{r} $$
#### Summary
A firm will attempt to choose the quantity of labor and capital that minimizes the total cost of producing a goal level of output
At the cost-minimizing combination of inputs
$MRTS = \frac{w}{r}$


#### Lesson 08.05 Cost Minimization Examples
1. Find $MRTS_{LK}$
	1. $MP_L$
	2. $MP_K$
	3. $MRTS_{LK} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$
2. $MktRIS = \frac{w}{r}$
3. Use Optimizing Condition: $MRTS_{LK} = MktRIS$
	1. Solve Optimizing Condition for k
4. Determine Labor and Capital
	1. Plug in the goal output into q in the production function
	2. Substitute 3.A. for K into Production Function
	3. Solve for L
	4. Use solution for L to find K by using the original Optimizing Condition from step 3.A.

#### Corner Solution
When your optimization condition cannot be true in the non-negative range of inputs amounts, then the firm will choose to only use one type of input or the other

$MRTS_{LK}:$ How productive is labor relative to capital
$w/r$: How expensive is labor relative to capital
$$ MRTS_{LK} > w/r $$
Labor is productive when compared to its relative cost. The firm could lower costs by substituting towards labor

$$ MRTS_{LK} < w/r $$
Labor is less productive when compared to its relative cost. The firm could lower costs by substituting away from labor

### Lesson 08.06 Long Run Cost
#### Summary
- In the short run, ATC curves are U-shaped due to capital being fixed
- In the long run, ATC is based on the type of returns to scale of the original production function 
- For realistic long run ATC curves, there will be a region of economy of scale which incentivizes the firm to increase the quantity of output
- There will also be a region of diseconomy of scale which means the firm does not want to produce too much output



## Lesson 9
### Lesson 09.01 Profit
#### Profit:
Difference between total revenue and total cost
$$ \pi(q) = R(q) - TC(q)$$
We use the $\pi$ sign because "P" is already used for Price

#### Revenue:
Price multiplied by quantity
$$ \text{Revenue} = P*q$$

#### Price Competition
Even though both firms have the ability to set price at whatever they like, competitive pressure drives the price down to marginal cost
In this situation, the presence of competition changed what the firms should do 

#### Price Takers
when firms(or buyers) take the market price as given and make their selling (or buying) decisions accordingly
##### Conditions for Price Taking Firms
Firms are more likely to be price takers when
- There are many sellers 
- There is product homogeneity
- There is free entry and exit

#### Profit-Maximization
##### Marginal Revenue
The change in revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output
Output (q) has no effect on Market Price
	Price = Marginal Revenue

Profit is  greatest at the quantity where $MR = MC$

#### Profit Maximization Steps
Profit maximization occurs at the quantity that makes $MR =MC$
1. Find $MR$ by taking the derivative of Revenue with respect to quantity
2. Find $MC$ by taking the derivative of Total Cost with respect to quantity
3. Set $MR = MC$
4. Solve for q

#### Find Minimum Average Total Cost
A minimum or maximum occurs when the slope of a line is equal to zero
1. Take the derivative of $ATC$ with respect to $q$
2. Set $\frac{\partial ATC}{\partial q} = 0$
3. Solve for q
4. Use q to solve for the min $ATC$ in dollars

#### Summary 
1. For Price Taker Firms, Price equals Marginal Revenue
2. Profit maximization occurs at the quantity where $MR = MC$
3. The rectangle formed from the height of Average Total Cost at a given quantity allows us to find Total Cost

### Lesson 09.02 Producer Surplus
#### Producer Surplus
The difference between the price and the minimum that a producer would have been willing to sell it for
The minimum price a producer would be willing to sell a good at is its marginal cost
Producer surplus will not consider the fixed cost in the short run, so $$\text{producer surplus} = \text{profit} + \text{total fixed cost}$$
Producer Surplus is the difference between total revenue and variable cost because PS ignores all fixed costs
$$PS(q) = R(q) - VC(q)$$
Notice that $$ AVC(q) = VC(q) / q$$
so $$VC(q) = AVC(q) \times q$$
#### Summary 
Producer Surplus(PS) is like profit, but PS ignores fixed cost
Producer surplus is the difference between the price and the minimum a producer would have been willing to sell for(the marginal cost)
Producer surplus is the area below price but above marginal cost and bounded on the right by the quantity

### Lesson 09.03 Loss and Short Run Shutdown
#### Short Run Loss
- In the short run, fixed costs are sunk and cannot be recovered 
- The firm will ignore any fixed costs and focus on the costs they can change. Marginal Costs and Variable Costs reflect these changeable costs
- If the price stays low, in the long run the firm will not rent the capital again. It will exit the market in the long run
- In the short run. however, it will make the best of the situation and produce the loss minimizing quantity of output
#### Zero Profit
Profit is zero when:
$$ P = ATC $$
For a price taker:
$$P = MR$$
For profit maximization:
$$MR = MC$$
We are looking for a point where:
$$ P = MR = MC = ATC $$
#### Breakeven Price
**The price at which the firm's profit is equal to zero**
This price can be found as the price associated with the minimum of the average total cost curve or where ATC and MC intersect -- the place where the slope of ATC is zero

#### Find Minimum Average Total Cost
A minimum or maximum occurs when the slope of a line is equal to zero
1. Take the derivative of $ATC$ with respect to $q$
2. Set $\frac{\partial ATC}{\partial q} = 0$
3. Solve for q
4. Use q to solve for the minimum ATC in dollars


#### Short Run Shutdown Price
The price at which the firm produces zero units in the short run

This price can be found as the price associated with the minimum of the average variable cost curve or where AVC and MC intersect

#### Summary
- The intersection between Average Total Cost and Marginal Cost helps you find the Breakeven Price
- The intersection between the Average Variable Cost and Marginal Cost helps you find the Short Run Shutdown Price

### Lesson 09.04 Complicated Cost Functions
1. MC intersects with the minimum of ATC -- Breakeven price
2. MC intersects with the minimum of AVC -- Short run shutdown price
#### Summary 
No matter what level of complication you use in the cost functions:
1. The breakeven price can be found at the intersection of ATC and MC
2. Thus shutdown price can be found at the intersection of AVC and MC

### Lesson 09.05 Profit in the Long Run
`Accounting Costs:` The total of all explicit costs
`Economic Costs:` The total of all explicit and implicit cost

`Free Entry:` When there are not barriers to entry
`Barriers to Entry: `Legal restrictions that prevent a firm from opening or increase the cost of opening

#### Profits in the Long Run
- Firms enter into markets with positive economic profit
- The extra production from these firms lower prices and thus lower economic profit
- This continues until economic profit is zero and no additional firms want to enter this market

- Firms exit from markets with negative economic profit
- The lower production from these firms raises price and thus raises economic profit
- This continues until economic profit is zero and no additional firms want to exit this market

`Normal Profit:` There is zero economic profit because accounting profit in every industry is the same. Investing in other industries will not gain a higher accounting return

`Excess Profit(Abnormal Profit): `A situation in which the economic profit is positive

#### Short Run ATC versus Long Run ATC
The minimums of short run ATC sketch out the long run ATC
If a firm can increase output and lower long run ATC, it is called an economy of scale
If a firm increases output and increase the long run ATC, it is called a diseconomy of scale

The quantity associated with the minimum of Long Run ATC is called the optimal firm size($q_{opt}$)
This quantity takes advantage of all economies of scale, but does not go into the diseconomy of scale range

#### Number of firms in the long run:
$$ n = \frac{Q_D}{q_{opt}}$$

`Constant-Cost Industry:` If new firms can enter the market, and all new firms have the same cost functions as old firms, then the Long Run Supply Curve is perfectly elastic

`Increasing-Cost Industry:` If new firms can enter the market, and that drives up input prices then average total costs will increase and the long run supply will be upward-sloping

`Decreasing-Cost Industry:` If new firms enter the market that leads to some economy of scale in the production of inputs which lowers average total costs and leads to a downward-sloping long run supply
This is a very unusual case, and it does not realistically describe many industries

#### Summary
- In the long run, profits cause firms to enter and prices and economics profit to slowly falls to zero
- In the long run, losses cause firms to exit and price and economic profits to rise to zero
- In the long run with free entry and identical firms, the price will be equal to the minimum of long run average total cost 
- At that price, each firm produces a quantity equal to the optimal firm size

### Lesson 09.06 Individual and Market Supply
#### Individual Supply Function
Mathematical relationship where quantity supplied by a single firm is a function of price
$$ q_s = f(P)$$
$\to$ Quantity supplied by a single firm is a function of price

#### Summary
Price-taker firms reat to a market price by determining the quantity they produce individually
In the case of profit-maximizing, price taker firms, price will be equal to marginal cost
Individual supply functions are based on the marginal cost of the individual firm
Market supply functions are the horizontal summation of all of the individual price-taker firm's production

## Lesson 10
### Lesson 10.01 Efficiency
#### Consumer Surplus
The price that a consumer is willing to pay(reservation price) for a good minus what the consumer actually pays for it

#### Producer Surplus
The difference between the price and the minimum that a producer would have been willing to sell it for
The minimum price a producer would be willing to sell a good at is its marginal cost

#### Gains from Trade
- Gains to society from producing a good with a value that was greater than its cost to produce
- Sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus
- aka total surplus or economic surplus

If market produce less than the equilibrium quantity will cause inefficient, the missing gains from trade is called `Deadweight Loss`

If market produces something more than the equilibrium quantity, it will also generate Deadweight Loss

#### Deadweight Loss
Inefficiency that arises from:
- Not producing a unit when the value of that unit was more than the cost
- Producing a unit when the cost of that unit was more than value

`Underproduction` results in missed producer and consumer surplus so entrepreneurs are incentivized to produce more to capture those gains from trade

`Overproduction` results in lost producer and consumer surplus since someone has to pay the cost which will incentivize producers to produce less

`Efficiency`: The property of a resource allocation of maximizing the gains from trade

#### Summary
- Shortage and surpluses cause price to adjust until we reach equilibrium
- A competitive equilibrium is efficient 
- Deviations from the competitively produced quantity create deadweight loss

### Lesson 10.02 Price Ceiling
#### Price Ceiling
A maximum price that any seller can legally charge

#### Rent Control
Laws which restrict how much rent can be increased. These restrictions may limit rent increases to be something based on the inflation rate or may be restrictions that limit landlords from increasing rent until a tenant voluntarily leaves

#### Summary
- A competitive market with a price ceiling will have deadweight loss
- Prices adjust to eliminate shortages
- Policies that prevent price adjustments come with costs to consumers and producers

### Lesson 10.03 Price Floors
#### Price Floor
A minimum price that any seller can legally charge

#### Price Support
A variation on the price floor policy.  The government sets a legal minimum price and also agrees to purchase any unsold units(surplus) at the minimum price

#### Summary
- A competitive market with a price floor will have deadweight loss
- Price floors have to be above the market-clearing price otherwise they have no effect
- Policies that prevent price adjustment come with costs to consumers and producers

## Lesson 11 
### Lesson 11.01 Per Unit Taxes
#### Lump Sum Tax
A certain dollar amount that is fixed

#### Ad Valorem Tax
A certain percentage of the price of the good

#### Per Unit(or specific) Tax
A certain dollar amount per unit of the good. The tax does not change as price changes

#### Gains from trade with a tax
Gains from trade when there is a tax will be the sum of:
1. Consumer Surplus
2. Producer Surplus
3. Tax Revenue

#### Summary
- A per unit tax levied on suppliers shifts supply upwards by the amount of the tax
- A tex when demand slopes downward and supply slopes upward causes
	1. Quantity to fall
	2. Price demanders pay to rise, and 
	3. Price suppliers keep to fall

### Lesson 11.02 Tax Burden
#### Tax Burden 
Percentage of tax paid by demanders versus suppliers
Also called `Tax Incidence`

#### Pass-through Fraction
An estimate of the percentage of a tax what will be passed through to the buyers
$$ \text{Pass-through Fraction} = \frac{E_s}{E_s - E_D}$$
This result is the part that consumers burden of the tax, the 1 - this fraction is the part taken by producer

#### Effects of Elasticity on Pass-Through and Burden
Tax burden is divided between demanders and suppliers
1. Higher demand elasticity means that demanders bear less and suppliers bear more of the tax burden
2. Higher supply elasticity means that demanders bear more and suppliers bear less of the tax burden

Perfectly Inelastic Demanders:
If demanders do not react to the price increase at all, then they will bear 100% of the tax burden

Perfectly Elastic Suppliers
If suppliers are infinitely price sensitive, they will pass 100% of the tax on to demanders

#### Perfectly Inelastic Suppliers
If suppliers cannot change the quantity they produce in response to a change in the price they receive, then they wil bear 100% of the tax burden

#### Perfectly Elastic Demanders
If demanders are infinitely price sensitive, they will not accept even a dollar increase in price. Suppliers will pass along 0% and therefore have to bear 100% of the tax

#### Payroll tax
A payroll tax is a tax levied on the wages of workers

#### Laffer Curve
Increasing taxes from zero will cause tax revenue to increase up until some point after which continuing to raise taxes will cause tax revenue to fall

Taxing goods with either inelastic demand or supply will cause the least deadweight loos and generate the most tax revenue

#### Summary
The way in which tax burden is split between demanders and suppliers is based on their relative elasticity
Increasing tax rates causes deadweight loss to increase at an increasing rate
Increasing taxes rates causes tax revenue to rise up until some point at which additional tax increasing cause tax revenue to fall

## Lesson 12
### Lesson 12.01 Imports and Exports
#### Autarky
When a nation produces exactly what it consumes. The nation does not import goods and does not export goods
Also called `self-sufficiency`

`Free Trade: `when a country has no barriers international trade. There are no tariffs or import quotas

`World Price:` the price on the world market. Consumers can purchase the good at the world price or the producers can sell the good at the world price

#### Tariff
Special additional tax on goods produced abroad and sold domestically
A tax on imports

#### Absolute Advantage
When nation can produce more output with a given amount of resources

#### Comparative Advantage:
When a nation can produce a unit of a good at a lower opportunity cost
A nation cannot have comparative advantage in producing all goods

#### Summary
- Importing and exporting increase gains from trade even if there are some parties that lose from trade
- Tariffs are an extremely costly way of protecting jobs because it forces us to produce goods at a higher opportunity cost and give up the chance to buy goods at a low price

### Lesson 12.02 Other Benefits of Trade
#### Effects of Monopoly
- Monopolies restrict output to drive price up
- When firms all over the world compete, prices fall
- Firms not only compete with each other by offering better prices, they also compete by offering better quality
#### Summary
There are many good things about free trade 
Many of the arguments against trade have flaws
Polls of economists find that 80% to 90% agree that trade deals have benefits most Americans
